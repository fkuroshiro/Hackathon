Explora is a gamified city-exploration mobile app designed to help citizens discover local businesses, cultural spots, and community events through an interactive map and quest system. Users earn XP and build reputation with various city “factions” (e.g., Culture, Local Business, History) by completing quests such as visiting places, attending events, or exploring new areas.

The app enables shops, restaurants, and organizations to easily add their location and create quests that reward users with XP and faction reputation. As players level up specific factions, they unlock real-world benefits—discounts, free entries, or access to exclusive events and communities.

CityQuest also features an AI-powered concierge that generates personalized exploration routes based on user interests, encouraging more meaningful and diverse city experiences.

The goal is to support local businesses, boost city engagement, and make urban exploration fun and rewarding through gamification. Trully helping gen Z to reconnect with the real world
